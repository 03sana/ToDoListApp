# TO DO LIST JavaScript Project

This is a JavaScript-based task manager web application that enables users to manage their tasks. The project showcases essential skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

## Key Features

- **Task Addition:** Add tasks with unique IDs, titles, and initial completion status.
- **Local Storage Integration:** Save and retrieve tasks using local storage for data persistence.
- **Dynamic UI:** Generate HTML elements dynamically to display tasks on the webpage.
- **Task Completion:** Toggle task completion status and style completed tasks.
- **User Interaction:** Interact with tasks through event listeners and intuitive UI buttons.

## Code Highlights

- Utilized event listeners to capture user actions, such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
- Demonstrated understanding of JSON by using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` for data serialization.
- Leveraged DOM manipulation to dynamically create and update task elements on the webpage.
- Implemented local storage functions (`localStorage.setItem()` and `localStorage.getItem()`) for seamless data persistence.
